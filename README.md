## Introduction
This project, titled "ApiLink", is a novel solution designed to streamline the development process in Spring projects. It primarily aims to eliminate the need for developers to create individual controllers. Instead, ApiLink enables a more efficient approach by allowing developers to invoke service layer methods through a single 'cmd' value. This approach significantly simplifies the development workflow and enhances productivity.

Additionally, ApiLink incorporates support for caching in WebSocket, relying on the Spring Boot WebSocket dependency. This feature is particularly beneficial for real-time applications where performance and efficiency are crucial. Moreover, the project offers a customizable handler, providing users with the flexibility to tailor the WebSocket behavior according to their specific requirements.

The overarching goal of ApiLink is to provide a convenient, efficient, and flexible tool for developers working on Spring projects, making the development process more streamlined and effective.
